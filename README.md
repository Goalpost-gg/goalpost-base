## A brief history

### Building through the bear

GOALPOST.gg started off as Bulls vs. Bears, in large part the brainchild of Niko, founder of Savage Labs Ltd. Bulls vs. Bears remained in alpha for most of the bear market in early 2023, during which a tight knit community formed around the game.

## Motivation

### Onboarding the next billion

As builders, it is our eternal mission to onboard the next billion to the blockchain. We believe this is possible through the creation of highly engaging, dopamine inducing social games built on top of Solana's massive speed and scalability. Blockchain games are currently synonymous with clunky experiences and gameplay, and this is something that we are intent on changing.

### Creating an integral social gaming platform

Easy to Learn, Fun to Play: GOALPOST is designed for ease of access and enjoyment, making it perfect for social play. Its engaging mechanics ensure high levels of excitement and satisfaction, fostering long-term player retention.

Unique Social Experience: Unlike many blockchain games, GOALPOST offers a social, interactive experience where players can compete, collaborate, and earn together.

## How to play

![Goalpost Bonk Table](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/227156100531748865/1249974819680686213/CleanShot_2024-06-11_at_02.32.592x.png?ex=66694144&is=6667efc4&hm=db7f95ff09f39b4393e5db5abfbe40c4499844e60392dfd545408678459b9edb&)

The purpose of the game is straightforward: at the beginning of the game, a player is randomly chosen to start. During each player's turn, three cards are displayed on the table - two cards face up and one card face down. The player whose turn it is must guess if the value of the face-down card falls between the values of the two face-up cards, winning double of their bet if correct. The game operates with a standard 52-card deck, ensuring that while the chances of guessing correctly are high, they are never guaranteed, maintaining an element of excitement and unpredictability in every round.

üîò Setup: Each game starts with players choosing a table and joining the game by contributing to a communal pot. The ante fee depends on the table they select, ensuring options that suit every player's budget. Each table can accommodate up to 8 players.

üîò Betting: Players take turns betting on whether the next card drawn will fall between two cards they have been dealt

üîò Bet Options: Players can choose to place a minimum bet, half the pot, the entire pot, or a custom amount within the set limits. They can also skip their turn if they think the odds are not in their favor.

üîò Outcome: If the player's guess is correct, they win according to their wager. If not, they lose their bet, and it stays in the communal pot.

üîò Game Cycle: The game continues in this cycle until the pot is cleared, creating a dynamic and engaging experience where strategy and anticipation are key.

## Building for BONKathon

With BONKathon in our sights, we decided to prioritize the addition of SPL tokens as in game currency to GOALPOST.gg, integrating it into our fee structure and building the experience around the branding. This also gave us the opportunity to take a look at expanding our collaboration with other established blue chip communities with their own community tokens.

## Current Implementation

### Seamless Onboarding with Hot Wallets

Players can simply sign in with their discord/email accounts to get started in no time. Every player is given a hot wallet that they can top-up with SOL or other tokens on Solana to play with. The hot wallet system is implemented using the [squads.so SDK](https://docs.squads.so/squads-v3-docs/development/sdk), making it possible to delegate control of these wallets to GOALPOST.

#### Scalability with DO Functions

### Frontend

## Next Phase

### VRF with Switchboard

VRF (Verifiable Random Function) implementation is critical for ensuring the fairness and transparency of the game. Our next step in moving out of alpha will be to integrate on-chain randomization using Switchboard VRF, allowing players to verify the fairness of each game round on-chain to enhance player confidence, leading to greater player retention and engagement.

Matrica Integration
We have secured a partnership with Matrica, and will be integrating their API to create a seamless onboarding process for communities, while making it easy for new users to join and start playing. This collaboration is an integral part
